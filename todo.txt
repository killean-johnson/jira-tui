Tui handles overarching UI pieces
boardlist becomes a layout
issuelist becomes a layout
issueview becomes a layout
editdesc becomes a layout
editstatus becomes a layout
editassignee becomes a layout
The helpbar gets its own layout, that way it's not being tossed around
The whole createissue becomes a layout

This allows for much more separation of code and cleaner maintenance when things need to be changed
